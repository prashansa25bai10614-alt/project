Problem Statement -
Managing daily shopping items can become difficult when users do not have a proper system to keep track of what they need to buy. People often forget items, duplicate purchases, or lose handwritten lists. To solve this problem, there is a need for a simple, efficient, and user-friendly tool that allows users to add, remove, and view items in their shopping list at any time.
This project aims to build a menu-driven Shopping List Management System using Python. The system allows users to maintain a digital shopping list without requiring advanced technical skills. It provides basic operations such as adding items, removing items, viewing the current list, and exiting the program. The solution is designed to be easy to operate, lightweight, and suitable for beginners, ensuring that users can manage their shopping items in a structured and organized way.







Scope of the Project — Shopping List Program

The scope of this project defines what the Shopping List Program can do and the boundaries of its functionality. This project focuses on creating a basic, user-friendly tool for managing shopping items through a text-based interface.

1. User Interaction
The program provides a clear menu with four main options.
Users can add items, remove items, view the list, and exit the program.
All interactions happen through simple text input.


2. Core Functionality
The project includes the following features:
Add Items: Users can add any number of items to the shopping list.
Remove Items: Users can delete specific items if they exist.
View Shopping List: Users can view all items in a clean, numbered format.
Exit Program: Allows users to safely exit the application.


3. Data Handling
Items are stored in a Python list in memory.
No external databases or files are used.
Data is not saved after closing the program.


4. Usability
The program is designed for beginners learning Python.
The interface is simple, menu-driven, and easy to understand.
Provides clear feedback for every operation.


5. Limitations Included in Scope
Since it is a basic project, the following are out of scope:
No GUI (Graphical User Interface).
No saving/loading of data to files.
No item categories, quantities, or sorting.
No login or multiple-user functionality.


6. Educational Scope
This project helps learners understand:
Loops
Functions
Lists and their operations
Conditional statements
User input handling
Basic program structure
